# Vue.Js and ASP.NET playground

Playground with [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) and [ASP.NET Core](https://asp.net) to understand, how Vue.js works and how
to leverage it in combination with ASP.NET Core.

## Technology used

The solution use the following technology:
- [Bootstrap CSS](https://getbootstrap.com/) for design.
- [ASP.NET](https://asp.net) as a technology to provide UI and code to call the API's.
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) the progressive and versatile framework for building user interfaces.
- [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) Vue Component Framework

## Setup required

If you will be working on your local machines, you will need to have:

1. [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows)
   installed
2. git installed - instructions step by step [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
3. [.NET](https://dot.net) installed to run the application if you want to run it locally
4. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed for leveraging NPM to install Vue.js (package managers are recommended like pnpm) 
5. You can use [Vue via CDN endpoint](https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js).
6. an editor (besides notepad) to see and work with code, scripts and more (for
   example [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) or [Jetbrains IDE](https://jetbrains.com))

There are different ways to install Vue.js, the easiest is adding reference to CDN via script tag:

``

<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js"></script>

``
